# TruthLens – Brutally Honest Video Feedback Agent

TruthLens is an AI-powered feedback agent designed for content creators who want **genuine, unfiltered critiques** of their video content. Unlike typical feedback tools that provide generic praise or surface-level suggestions, TruthLens delivers **brutally honest, actionable insights** without any sugarcoating.

## 🚩 Problem

Content creators often struggle to get **authentic feedback**:

- Friends and followers are usually too polite.
- Many AI tools give **vague, generic compliments**.
- Real issues in content, editing, or storytelling go unmentioned.
- This lack of honest critique **slows growth** and hides a creator’s true potential.
